# Purpose
With this repository I want to achieve 2 goals:
1. **Have a lookup notes** that I can use as reminder when doing *software design* or *refractoring* myself
2. **Showcase my familiarity** with *design patterns*

# Repository structure
Each directory contains materials on a certain *design pattern*. Those include:
- a dummy `typescript` code
- `.md` file with notes

# Disclaimer
Many elements of the `.md` files (images and some portions of text) are from the following source:
- [refractoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru/)
